* The Cassini mission came to an end in September 2017, and the ERC team at Leicester were involved in a number of media activities associated with the end of mission.  Two publications have been prepared by Dr. Fletcher that deal with Cassini infrared spectroscopy spanning the entire mission, 2004 to 2017:  the first (published in Nature Astronomy) investigates the evolution of Saturn's tropical oscillations in the equatorial stratosphere, and the substantial perturbation caused by the Great Northern Storm of 2010-2013 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41550-017-0271-5); the second looks at the changes occurring in the polar regions as Saturn's northern summer approached (submitted).  In addition, Dr. Richard Achterberg (Collaborator) has used the high-resolution infrared observations from Cassini's final orbits to understand the properties of Saturn's polar cyclones (https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL078157); and Dr. Sandrine Guerlet (Collaborator) used Cassini observations of Saturn's limb to further understand the equatorial oscillations (https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JE005419).

* Dr. James Blake joined the Leicester team in March 2018, and is focussing on exploiting two sources of ground-based observations of Saturn:  the first is a long baseline of infrared imaging from 1984 to the present day to study interannual variability; the second is the high-resolution spectroscopy acquired by the TEXES spectrometer on the IRTF to study the chemistry of the stratosphere.  Proposals for new IRTF and VLT observations of Saturn have been submitted to the observatories.

* Dr. Henrik Melin (ERC Collaborator) has been working with Cassini UVIS data on Jupiter (an STFC-supported project), and the spectral inversion tools will ultimately be used as part of this theme to study Saturn.

* Guaranteed-time observations of Saturn's north polar atmosphere and rings (programme ID 1247) using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have been awarded and prepared for execution in the first year of operations.
