* This theme will use existing ground- and space-based observations of the ice giants to prepare for observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), where guaranteed time observations of both worlds (programme IDs 1248 and 1249) have been awarded and prepared by Dr. Fletcher.

* Ms. Naomi Rowe-Gurney arrived in Leicester in September 2017 to begin a PhD thesis mining the archive of Spitzer observations of both Uranus and Neptune (disc-averaged due to the small angular size of these planets).  Her preliminary analysis of rotational variation in ice giant emission presented at the COSPAR meeting in July 2018.

* Earth-based observations of both ice giants with the TEXES instrument on the IRTF and the VISIR instrument on the VLT have been reduced and analysis is in progress, with preliminary findings presented at the COSPAR meeting in July 2018.  Additional observations of Neptune have been awarded and will be executed in 2018.  Dr. Michael Roman (ERC PDRA) will continue with this analysis from September 2017 onwards.

* Dr. Julianne Moses (Collaborator) produced a seasonal photochemical model of both ice giants in the absence of dynamics, which was used to predict the appearance of both worlds using JWST (http://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.02.004); Joshua Tollefson (Collaborator) used our temperature inversions to explore thermal windshear in Neptune's atmosphere (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.04.009); and Prof. Patrick Irwin (Collaborator) presented the first detections of hydrogen sulphide above the clouds of Uranus using observations from Gemini (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-018-0432-1).

* The ERC team continue to advocate for a future mission to the Ice Giants, helping to write the science case for future entry probes for an ice giant atmosphere (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2017.10.005) and convening an Ice Giant session and workshop at the 2018 COSPAR conference in Pasadena, California.
