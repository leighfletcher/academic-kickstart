# Overview:

This 2018 workshop brought together the Juno team, citizen scientists, and amateur astronomers to support the science of the Juno mission at Jupiter.  The workshop was principally funded by EuroPlanet 2020 (with funding from the EU), with major contributions from the the European Research Council (ERC) and the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS).  Attendance of the workshop was by invitation or nomination only.

A Europlanet press release on the workshop is [available here](http://www.europlanet-eu.org/new-views-of-jupiter-showcases-swirling-clouds-on-giant-planet/).

Interviews with the guests and attendees were showcased on the [Royal Astronomical Society's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUZJ5FO9ayrmepOM4FHAASw).

The final agenda for the workshop [can be found here](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics/people/leighfletcher/images/copy_of_RASJuno_agenda.pdf). The slides are available towards the bottom of this webpage.

*This workshop was supported by Europlanet 2020 RI NA1 - Innovation through Science Networking, Task 5: Coordination of ground based observations. Europlanet 2020 RI has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 654208.*



# Background:

Amateur planetary imaging can provide a valuable resource for scientific study.  Images from amateurs around the globe are commonly used to augment professional ground-based and space-based studies of Jupiter’s atmospheric features, in view of their complementary wavelength coverage and their ability to keep track of complex time-varying phenomena.  In recent years there has been increasing direct collaboration, especially during the NASA Juno mission in which the spacecraft camera (JunoCam) is intended for ‘public outreach’ but is also producing new scientific discoveries.

A EuroPlanet-sponsored workshop was held in May 2016 in Nice, France, and was very successful in informing amateur and professional groups of each others’ capabilities and needs and engendering cooperation for future studies of Jupiter.  Juno successfully entered orbit around the giant planet in July 2016, delivering new insights into the origins, interior, atmosphere and magnetosphere from its regular perijoves.  Along with many ground-based professional observations, amateurs are playing a significant role in tracking the changing features on the planet that are relevant to targetting of both JunoCam and the Microwave Radiometer (MWR).  The relevant Juno instruments have now acquired almost two years worth of data, so this will be an ideal time to take stock of the achievements to date, and to plan for further pro-am collaboration in future years regarding professional Earth-based observing programmes (e.g., support for JWST and ESA's JUICE mission).



# Structure and content of the Workshop:

The workshop aimed to promote collaboration between amateur astronomers and professional space scientists in studies of the atmosphere of Jupiter, in support of the ongoing NASA Juno mission and future ground-based studies. The meeting brought together ~60 amateur and professional observers and researchers from Europe and across the world, including members of the NASA Juno project.  We invited ~30 leading amateurs (some who take images, some who analyse and interpret them, and some who develop software tools), plus ~10 professionals.  Invitees were principally from Europe, but included a few leading amateurs in the Far East and Australia. Remaining places were offered to selected amateurs and professionals on an unfunded basis.

The programme included both professional talks (typically ~20-30 minutes) and amateur talks (typically ~5-20 minutes).  The talks were intended to promote lively interaction, with substantial time allocated to discuss each topic.

## Topics included:

* Review of scientific results from Juno atmospheric experiments – including the (Italian) JIRAM instrument, as well as JunoCam and MWR.
* Review of Jupiter’s climatic cycles and recent/forthcoming opportunities to obtain multi-wavelength observations at different stages of them.
* Outline of recent and ongoing contributions of amateur astronomers to Jupiter science.
* Coordination of amateur observations with Juno and with ground-based observations, considering the most scientifically valuable goals.
* Updates of recent technical developments in the last few years (cameras, optics, software tools), and discussion of desirable improvements and innovations.
* Consideration of the existing databases of amateur and professional images, and whether they can be improved for contributors and users.
