* Recent publications have explored the moist convective plumes responsible for the revival of Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt in 2009-2011 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.01.001), the 3-5 year cycle of expansion activity within Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt (http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GL073383), and a review of cyclic activity across all of Jupiter's main belts (http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GL073806).

* Dr. Arrate Antunano-Martin arrived in Leicester in October 2017 and is working with an infrared dataset spanning more than three jovian years (1983-2018) to identify periodicities and their underlying causes in the jovian atmosphere.  The first of several papers on this topic has been published in GRL (https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL080382).

* Dr. Henrik Melin (ERC Collaborator) published a study using the TEXES spectrometer on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, expanding on our previous work mapping Jupiter's temperatures, clouds and composition on a single date (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2016.06.008) to understand the variations of stratospheric hydrocarbons over half a jovian year (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.12.041).  This same instrument was used by Dr. Richard Cosentino (Collaborator at Goddard Spaceflight Center) to understand Jupiter's Quasi-Quadrennial Oscillation (https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JE005342); by Dr. James Sinclair (Collaborator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) to explore the upper atmospheric heating from Jupiter's powerful auroras (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.09.016); and by Doriann Blain (Paris Observatory) to map Jupiter's tropospheric ammonia (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.06.002).  Our ERC-funded programme of TEXES observations continues to be awarded time on the IRTF.

* Dr. Leigh Fletcher and Mr. Padraig Donnelly (ERC Collaborator) have continued to support Juno's close flybys of Jupiter using the Very Large Telescope in Chile, including a successful visitor-mode run in May 2018 that coincided perfectly with Juno's 13th perijove.  High-resolution thermal maps of Jupiter will be presented at upcoming conferences, and we are continuing our campaign of Earth-based support for the Juno mission.

* Dr. Fletcher co-organised (with Dr. John Rogers of the British Astronomical Association) a Europlanet-funded workshop at the Royal Astronomical Society in London to bring together members of the Juno team with professional and amateur astronomers exploring atmospheric variability on Jupiter.

* Guaranteed-time observations of Jupiter's Great Red Spot (programme ID 1246) using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have been awarded and prepared for execution in the first year of operations.
