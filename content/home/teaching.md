I supervise graduate (PhD) students, Masters research projects (4th year undergraduates) and advanced reading projects, and 3rd-year BA projects.

In addition, I manage the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) on behalf of the Physics and Astronomy Department.

I have previously served as a tutor for Atmospheric and Climate Physics, Astrophysics, Fluid Flows and Complexity, Exoplanet Atmospheres.
