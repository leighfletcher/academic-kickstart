Dr. Leigh Fletcher is a Planetary Scientist specialising in the exploration of our Solar System's giant planets via
robotic spacecraft missions and ground-based astronomical facilities.  He is a Royal Society University 
Research Fellow (URF) and Associate Professor in Planetary Sciences at the University of Leicester.    

He earned a Natural Science degree from Cambridge, a PhD in Planetary Physics from Oxford, and has since worked as a NASA 
fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and as a Research Fellow at Oxford.  He was the recipient of the 2016 Harold C. 
Urey prize for outstanding achievements in planetary science by an early-career scientist, awarded by the Division for 
Planetary Sciences (DPS) of the American Astronomical Society.  He is a co-investigator on the Cassini mission to Saturn, 
the JUICE mission to Jupiter, and a passionate advocate for future exploration of the distance Ice Giants.  He currently leads 
a planetary atmospheres team at the University of Leicester, funded by the Royal Society, STFC, and the European Research 
Council.
