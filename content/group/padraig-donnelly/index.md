## Biography
Padraig Donnelly is a postgraduate researcher at the University of Leicester, specialising in the atmosphere of Jupiter. He uses a ground-based dataset from the Very Large Telescope in Chile to characterise the temporal variability in the Jovian troposphere and stratosphere as part of a ground wider support campaign for NASAâ€™s Juno spacecraft providing the much-needed simultaneous mid-infrared measurements for each approach as well as putting these into the context the entire Jovian year leading up to and including the Juno epoch. He is a keen supporter of the collaborative professional-amateur astronomy community and participates in scientific and University of Leicester Physics outreach events.
