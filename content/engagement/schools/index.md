## Space School:  
The University of Leicester's [Space School](http://spaceschool.co.uk/) celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2019, and I was invited to give a lecture on my planetary research to their "senior school" (16-18 year olds) in August 2019, focussing on future missions to the Ice Giants.  I previously provided a lecture at the Space School 2016, on exploring giant planet atmospheres.

## Primary Schools
* Discovery Schools Academy Trust (DSAT) Science Conference:  March 16th, 2019:  Return to give the opening Science Talk at their annual science conference, approximately 100 specially-selected primary school science students in attendance.
* Parkland Primary School (Jan 30th 2019):  An afternoon giving presentations and Q&A sessions with two yeargroups at the DSAT Parkland School, speaking with Year 5s and Year 1s (approximately 150 pupils in total).  The presentation tried to showcase the different scales of our solar system, from the size of their school to the size of the universe.  The questions were excellent and kept me talking.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thankyou for coming to talk with the children!

* Parkland Primary School (September 20th 2018):  Skype conversation during their whole-school assembly, describing how I got into my role as a scientist, and answering the student's questions about science and space.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An inspiring Skype session with <a href="https://twitter.com/LeighFletcher?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LeighFletcher</a>.
