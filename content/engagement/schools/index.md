## Space School:  
The University of Leicester's [Space School](http://spaceschool.co.uk/) celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2019, and I was invited to give a lecture on my planetary research to their "senior school" (16-18 year olds) in August 2019, focussing on future missions to the Ice Giants.  I previously provided a lecture at the Space School 2016, on exploring giant planet atmospheres.
