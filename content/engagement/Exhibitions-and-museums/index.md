* Planets 2018:  Reimagining Holst's Planets Suite a Century On:  I was invited to work on a Live Music Sculpture event produced by Sound UK and funded by Arts Council England, National Lottery and RVW Trust.  I was tasked with working with composer Richard Bullen to create a new composition of Holst's Jupiter, inspired by our scientific discoveries over the past century.  These were performed to a live audience in four planetariums (Greenwich, Winchester, Bristol and Birmingham) by the Ligeti Quartet, and I provided an introduction to planetary science at the Thinktank Museum, Birmingham, on October 2nd 2018.  The website for the events is [here](https://www.sounduk.net/events/planets-2018/), the music is now available via [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/sounduk/sets/the-planets-2018), the Leicester press release is [here](https://le.ac.uk/news/2018/october/02-jupiter-planets-suite), and the 4* Guardian review is [here](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/01/the-planets-2018-ligeti-quartet-review).
