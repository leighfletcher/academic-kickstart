## Podcasts

* ITN Podcast on Exoplanets (commissioned by audible.com) - recorded in Leicester on October 10th 2019.
* Space Boffins:  recorded a discussion of future missions to the Ice Giants at the UK Space Conference, September 25th 2019.
* Space is the Place  (November 2017):  Visited HM Prison Leicester to record four radio shows about space, to be broadcast across National Prison Radio.  Four programmes were recorded back to back with Q&A from an audience of the prison residents, covering topics such as Observing the Universe, Life in Space, The Earth from Space, and the UK Space Agency.  An article from Prison Radio can be [found here](https://prison.radio/space-is-the-place/).  This was funded by a £9000 UKSA grant to HMP Leicester Library, working with the National Space Centre and National Prison Radio, to make at least four radio programmes (15-min each) on inspirational subjects related to space, including the UK in Space. Made with prisoners and experts, together with Robin Ince, host of Radio4’s Infinite Monkey Cage, and broadcast over NPR’s 24/7 network, they will reach thousands of prisoners of all ages and gender in UK prisons and YOIs.
